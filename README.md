In this repository I will upload a series of algorithms and solutions using different techniques to achieve the best performance.

## [Reversal sentences](https://github.com/MerliMejia/Dynamic-programming-practices/tree/master/Reversal%20sentences "Reversal sentences")

**This was the first algorithm that I set out to solve:**

You are given an array of characters arr that consists of sequences of characters separated by space characters. Each space-delimited sequence of characters defines a word.

Implement a function reverseWords that reverses the order of the words in the array in the most efficient manner.

Explain your solution and analyze its time and space complexities.

Example:

**input: arr = [ 'p', 'e', 'r', 'f', 'e', 'c', 't', ' ',
'm', 'a', 'k', 'e', 's', ' ',
'p', 'r', 'a', 'c', 't', 'i', 'c', 'e' ]
output: [ 'p', 'r', 'a', 'c', 't', 'i', 'c', 'e', ' ',
'm', 'a', 'k', 'e', 's', ' ',
'p', 'e', 'r', 'f', 'e', 'c', 't' ]**

I spend 1H:45MM traying to solve this algorithm in the most efficient manner. The final result runs on O(N2). You can read the code [HERE](https://github.com/MerliMejia/Dynamic-programming-practices/blob/master/Reversal%20sentences/src/main.java)
